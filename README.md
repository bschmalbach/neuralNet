# Neural Net

The goal of the present exercise was to predict whether a banknote is fake or real based on the distribution properties of Wavelet Transformed images.
Just descriptively, there were already readily apparant differences between real and fake notes.

As was to be expected, the neural net performed very well in distinguishing the real from the fake notes both, in the training and the testing data (100% accuracy in both cases).
